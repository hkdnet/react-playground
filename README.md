# 3ch react sandbox
this is a sandbox for 3ch to play with React.js

## prepare

First, install dependencies.  
`npm i`

[Optional] Second, install gulp globally.  
this is optional but we recommend you to do so for easy development  
`npm i -g gulp`

Then, you can run your application.  
`gulp run`

## dev

`/dev` is the only directory where you edit  
after edit, you should `gulp build`  
then files under `/dev` are compiled and moved to `/public`, where `json-server` shows

## env
